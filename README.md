# FastSME

The landing site for **FastSME** — an open-source platform bringing enterprise-grade software to SMEs and SMBs globally at affordable prices.

FastSME is operated by Exroad Fintech Ltd and the source is published at [github.com/predictivelabsai](https://github.com/predictivelabsai).

## Local development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The app listens on `http://localhost:5001` by default and honours the `PORT` environment variable.

## Tests

```bash
pip install pytest playwright
python -m playwright install chromium
python -m pytest tests/test_pages.py -v
```

Browser artifacts are written to `output/playwright/`.

## Languages

The public site is available in English, Estonian, German, French, Swedish,
Latvian, Norwegian, Danish, Polish, Dutch, Finnish and Lithuanian. The first
visit follows the browser's supported language preference; a selection from
the top navigation is stored in the signed session and preserves the current
route.

Checked-in catalogues live in `content/locales/`. Validate that every public
source string is translated with:

```bash
python scripts/update_i18n.py
```

Maintainers can generate missing catalogue entries with `--translate`. This is
an explicit maintenance command that sends only public English site copy to the
translation service; deployed requests never call an external translator.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t fastsme .
docker run --rm -p 5001:5001 fastsme
curl http://localhost:5001/healthz
```

See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) for the Coolify and CI/CD setup.
